**Zeus** is a fast, local coding agent for your terminal. It's a community-driven fork of `openai/codex` focused on real developer ergonomics: Browser integration, multi-agents, theming, and reasoning control ‚Äî all while staying compatible with upstream.

Interactions with git take fucking ages, no idea why they're so slow, should maybe automatically swap to a smaller model for that

## What's new in v0.4.0 (October 26, 2025)

- **Auto Drive upgraded** ‚Äì hand `/auto` a task and it now plans, coordinates agents, reruns checks, and recovers from hiccups without babysitting.
- **Unified settings** ‚Äì `/settings` centralizes limits, model routing, themes, and CLI integrations so you can audit configuration in one place.
- **Card-based activity** ‚Äì Agents, browser sessions, web search, and Auto Drive render as compact cards with drill-down overlays for full logs.
- **Turbocharged performance** ‚Äì History rendering and streaming were optimized to stay smooth even during long multi-agent sessions.
- **Smarter agents** ‚Äì Mix and match orchestrator CLIs (Claude, Gemini, GPT-5, Qwen, and more) per `/plan`, `/code`, or `/solve` run.

&ensp;
## Usage

### Run

```bash
npx -y @just-every/zeus
```

### Install & Run

```bash
npm install -g @just-every/zeus
zeus // or `zeusr` if you're using VS Code
```

Note: If another tool already provides a `zeus` command (e.g. VS Code), our CLI is also installed as `zeusr`. Use `zeusr` to avoid conflicts.

**Authenticate** (one of the following):
- **Sign in with ChatGPT** (Plus/Pro/Team; uses models available to your plan)
  - Run `zeus` and pick "Sign in with ChatGPT"
- **API key** (usage-based)
  - Set `export OPENAI_API_KEY=xyz` and run `zeus`

### Install Claude & Gemini (optional)

Zeus supports orchestrating other AI CLI tools. Install these and config to use alongside Zeus.

```bash
# Ensure Node.js 20+ is available locally (installs into ~/.n)
n install 20

# Install Claude CLI (requires Anthropic API key)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-cli
claude --version

# Install Gemini CLI
npm install -g @google/generative-ai-cli
gemini --version

# Install Qwen CLI (requires Alibaba Cloud API key)
npm install -g @alibaba-cloud/qwen-cli
qwen --version
```

### Browser
```bash
# Connect Zeus to external Chrome browser (running CDP)
/chrome        # Connect with auto-detect port
/chrome 9222   # Connect to specific port

# Browser sessions are available in command selection dropdown or `/solve` when working with web apps
```

&ensp;
## CLI reference

```shell
zeus [options] [prompt]

Options:
  --model <name>        Override the model (gpt-5, claude-opus, etc.)
  --no-approval         Auto-approve file changes (caution!)
  --read-only           Prevent modifications (analysis only)
  --auto                Start in Auto Drive mode
  --help                Show help message
```

&ensp;
## Memory & project docs

Zeus can remember context across sessions:

1. **Create an `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` file** in your project root:
```markdown
# Your project name

This is a React TypeScript application with:
- `/client/` - React components and UI
- `/server/` - Backend services
```

2. **Session memory**: Zeus maintains conversation history
3. **Codebase analysis**: Automatically understands project structure

&ensp;
## Automation & CI/CD

For automation and CI/CD:

```shell
# Run a specific task
zeus --no-approval "run tests and fix any failures"

# Generate reports
zeus --read-only "analyze code quality and generate report"

# Batch processing
zeus --config output_format=json "list all TODO comments"
```

&ensp;
## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Zeus supports MCP for extended capabilities:

- **File operations**: Advanced file system access
- **Database connections**: Query and modify databases
- **API integrations**: Connect to external services
- **Custom tools**: Build your own extensions

Configure MCP in `~/.zeus/config.toml` Define each server under a named table like `[mcp_servers.<name>]` (this maps to the JSON `mcpServers` object used by other clients):

```toml
[mcp_servers.filesystem]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/project"]
```

&ensp;
## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `~/.zeus/config.toml`:

```toml
[general]
default_model = "claude-opus"
approval_mode = "review"  # "review", "auto", or "manual"

[themes]
current = "dark"
accent_color = "blue"

[mcp_servers]
# Your MCP server configurations here
```

&ensp;
## Architecture

### Core Components

- **TUI** ‚Äì Terminal user interface (Rust using Ratatui)
- **Core Agent** ‚Äì Multi-model orchestration
- **Tool Runner** ‚Äì File operations, browser control, MCP
- **Model Provider** ‚Äì Abstraction for LLM APIs

### Key Patterns

- **Browser integration** ‚Äì Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) for automation
- **Streaming** ‚Äì Real-time token streaming from all supported LLMs
- **Stateful UI** ‚Äì Maintains context across tool executions
- **MCP** ‚Äì Pluggable tool system for extending capabilities
